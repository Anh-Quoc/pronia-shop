# E-commerce Demo

This is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website using the Java Servlet. The application loads
products a Microsoft SQL Server database and displays them. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can
click on any product to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating. Users can select items and
add them to their shopping cart

## Import Data
